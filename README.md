## Neural Style Transfer

The *painting* of the North Wales Tech logo presented here has been created by applying ***A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style*** as presented by Leon A. Gatys, Alexander S. Ecker, Matthias Bethge in their 2015 paper available here: https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576

In this paper the authors present an Artificial Intelligence system based on a Deep Neural Network that creates artistic images by separating and recombining neural representations of content and style from arbitrary images. The authors note the following observation of interest:

> In fine art, especially painting, humans have mastered the skill to
> create unique visual experiences through composing a complex interplay
> between the content and style of an image. Thus far the algorithmic
> basis of this process is unknown and there exists no artificial system
> with similar capabilities.

This technique is these days more commonly known as **Neural Style Transfer**.

## Creating the Style Transfered NWT Logo

### Style Input: The Scream by Edvard Munch in 1893

Norwegian: Skrik
German: Der Schrei der Natur (The Scream of Nature)

> I was walking along the road with two friends – the sun was setting –
> suddenly the sky turned blood red – I paused, feeling exhausted, and leaned
> on the fence – there was blood and tongues of fire above the blue-black
> fjord and the city – my friends walked on, and I stood there trembling with
> anxiety – and I sensed an infinite scream passing through nature.
> 
> -- Edvard Munch

Many commentators have suggested the painting represents the *the anxiety of modern man*.
