The *painting* of the North Wales Tech logo presented here has been created by applying:

## A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style

.. as presented by Leon A. Gatys, Alexander S. Ecker, Matthias Bethge in their 2015 paper:

Artificial Intelligence based on a Deep Neural Network separates and
recombinies neural representations of content and style from the images.


## The Scream by Edvard Munch in 1893

Norwegian: Skrik, German: Der Schrei der Natur

> I was walking along the road with two friends – the sun was setting –
> suddenly the sky turned blood red – I paused, feeling exhausted, and leaned
> on the fence – there was blood and tongues of fire above the blue-black
> fjord and the city – my friends walked on, and I stood there trembling with
> anxiety – and I sensed an infinite scream passing through nature.
> 
> Edvard Munch

The anxiety of modern man?
